## About the Project

TekkenLearningPlatform keeps track of your matches and provides statistics to help you improve as a player. Optionally, it can also record your matches and automatically upload them to YouTube.

### Features

- Detect when you enter and exit matches
  - Automatically start recording to video when you enter a match
  - Automatically pause recording when you exit a match
  - Match results are saved
- A web application that shows you key performance metrics for your characters
  - Statistics for certain matchups and stages
  - A list of your most played opponents ("rivals") and how you perform against them
  - A match history allowing you to check details for every single match you played and watch the recording of it
- Automatically upload your recordings to your YouTube channel
- Individual featues can be turned on/off via undocumented environment variables (hehe)

### Planned Features

- Queue up video uploads and wait until the game is closed to do so
- Improve display of input notations in the recording
- Add frame data to the recording
- Add missed punishment opportunities to the recording
- Add pagination to match history (currently limited the latest 10 games)
- Improve YouTube video metadata for uploaded recordings
- Add additional statistics to matches
  - Moves you get hit most often by
  - Moves that you failed to punish most often
  - Your most used moves and whether they hit or whiffed or were punished

### Known Bugs and Limitations

- Matches ending prematurely e.g. due to disconnects are not detected properly
- Videos are uploaded to YouTube during gameplay which may results in a bad connection
